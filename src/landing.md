# Introduction

This Code-Along was made for a talk in the HPC-NRW seminar on  [Datalad](https://www.datalad.org) and describes two Code-Alongs. The first one has some basic usage in it, while the second one deals with the usage of Datalad on a cluster.
While the exercises shown here are self-made, the setup for the second example is based on [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464122v1).
