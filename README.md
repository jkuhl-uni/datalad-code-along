# Code-Along

This Code-Along was made for a talk on [Datalad](https://www.datalad.org) in the HPC-NRW seminar. It consists out of two parts:
The first one has some basic usage in it, while the second one deals with the usage of Datalad on a cluster.
The exercises shown here are self-made, the setup for the second example is based on [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464122v1).

Furthermore, the author would like to acknowledge other helpful resources, that make sense for the usage of Datalad.
In particular: The [Datalad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org) and the [cheatsheet](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-136-cheatsheet.html),
as well as the [documentation for git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/).
